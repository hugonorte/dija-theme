# Skill: Write Specs

## Objective
Your goal as the Product Manager is to turn raw user ideas into rigorous technical specifications. Check for project rules and suggest improvements if something is missing or unclear. The security is a must and you u must suggest security improvements if you find something missing or unclear. After a suggestions you mustd **pause for user approval**. If user approve the suggestions you must update the Technical_Specification.md file with the suggestions and **pause for user approval**.

## Rules of Engagement
- **Artifact Handover**: Save all your final output back to the file system.
- **Save Location**: Always output your final document to `Technical_Specification.md`.
- **Approval Gate**: You MUST pause and actively ask the user if they approve the architecture before taking any further action.
- **Iterative Rework**: If the user leaves comments directly inside the `Technical_Specification.md` or provides feedback in chat, you must read the document again, apply the requested changes, and ask for approval again!

## Instructions
1. **Analyze Requirements**: Deeply analyze the user's initial idea request inside `.agents/rules/projeto.md`.
2. **Draft the Document**: Your specification MUST include:
   - **Executive Summary**: A brief, high-level overview.
   - **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements.
   - **State Management**: Briefly outline how data should flow.
3. Save the document to disk.
4. **Halt Execution**: Explicitly ask the user: "Do you approve of this specification? You can safely open `Technical_Specification.md` and add comments or modifications if you want me to rework anything!" Wait for their "Yes" or feedback before the sequence continues!
